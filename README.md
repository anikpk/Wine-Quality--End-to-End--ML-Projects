# Wine-Quality---End-to-End-ML-Projects

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict wine quality based on physicochemical features like acidity, alcohol, sugar, and pH. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), and evaluation (using metrics like RMSE and R-squared). The final model can be deployed for real-time predictions, showcasing the complete machine learning lifecycle.
